      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        I am a experienced systemtechnician. I have a widely expanded education base
        that include networking technology, system and network administration, TCP/IP, 
        routing and switching on Cisco and HP-Procurve hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2010 i took a education year and read a RIA path and social media. In the course
        I have learned to program Rich Internet Applications (RIA), with HTML, XHTML, HTML5, 
        CSS3, Flash, JQuery, Javascript, XML and actionscript 3 (Flash).<br />
        The course has a real drill on Adobes Creative Suite 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        With good knowledge of several UNIX dialects which I made program on, the feedback has
        been good from my former employments. I have some knowledge about microsoft windows domain building and LDAP/X500. I also made some script in office component extensions.
